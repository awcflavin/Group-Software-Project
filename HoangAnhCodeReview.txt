Code Review
Author: Hoang Anh Mai
File: signup.php
Link: https://github.com/awcflavin/Group-Software-Project/blob/master/signup/signup.php

Purpose:
Make signup page for friendly to user. Initially, after fill in the form server will bring user to a new page with the result of signup.
This version, if signup fail, user will be directed to signup page with error message at the beginning of the form. Otherwise, redirect user to Pages tabs
where they can find the exam papers.

Review:
Much cleaner interface for signup, easier for user to create an account. No bug so far with this version of signup.

HTML file is very well designed, the form is also very easy to use.

Some necessary blank space in the signup.php file but can be easily fixed. Also some comments can be added to increase maintainability.
