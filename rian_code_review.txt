File: setup.php
Link: https://github.com/awcflavin/Group-Software-Project/blob/master/setup.php

Code Function:
	This program is responsible for logging into MySQL and setting up the connection
	to the database.
	
Code Review:
	The commit contains 34 lines and only 11 of these are lines of code in use. 
	The rest of the lines are blank space, 3 minimal comment lines and code that was 
	originally intended for execution but was since deemed to not be used so was just 
	commented out. All of this clutter reduces the level of readability of the file and 
	increases file size.
	The code itself however, performs well. All variables are laid out clearly and it 
	is functional as intended while remaining concise (Again, the actual code in use).

File: signup.php
Link: https://github.com/awcflavin/Group-Software-Project/blob/master/signup.php

Code Function:
	Present user with a form to fill in personal details required for an account, then 
	use these details to create an account for the user and add it to the database. 
	During this process preforming certain validation checks such as ensuring passwords
	entered by the user match and checking the validity of the email address against the
	database.
	
Code Review:
	Readability of code is maintained at a very high level. Code laid out clearly and 
	well; minimally commented, however efficiently. Clean, well designed user display 
	via the HTML portion of the file.
	Code seemingly bug free at this point and runs efficiently and correctly.
