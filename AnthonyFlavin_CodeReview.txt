Code Review 1

Purpose:

This file implements the selection of the college course that the user wishes to retrieve past exam papers of.
Firstly, the college that the user is attending is found via a database query this is then added to their
session data. The database is then queried to provide the courses available in that college. Results are
displayed to the user as links to the papers.php page with the course code as GET form data. papers.php will
then display the papers available for that specific course.

Review:

Firstly, best practices are not abided by with a lack of comments explaining the functionality of the code,
particularly the PHP. This needs to be updated in order to improve the readability and maintainability of
the project. Additionally there appears to be a lot of empty lines that are unnecessary and make the file
hard to read. Indentation is also inconsistent.

The html portion is exceptionally well laid out and conforms to a high standard of readability.

The code seems to function as intended without any bugs as far as I can find. The setup of the database and
the security for the login have been implemented in their own files and included here. This reduces the amount
of redundant code significantly.
